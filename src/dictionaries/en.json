        {"id": 1, "tag": "#billboard", "title": "Billboard", "desc": "Environmental advertising, which generally includes all types of urban and interurban billboards, is cost-effective compared to other influential media in reaching a large population. Considering the significant amount of time people spend in urban areas, especially with traffic congestion in most hours in major cities, environmental advertising is well-received. Currently, billboards come in various sizes and capabilities across the city. The key to the success of this type of advertising lies in selecting suitable billboards in strategic locations. Factors such as the community's traffic routes, peak traffic hours, billboard size, screening duration, etc., must be taken into account. NamaAd Advertising Agency, with its long-standing experience and specialized presence in environmental advertising, can be a reliable consultant for you to achieve the best results for your brand with minimal costs."},
        {"id": 2, "tag": "#bus", "title": "Bus", "desc": "Advertising on the body of buses is one of the effective and practical methods that, considering the lower cost compared to other environmental media, can be a suitable option for low-budget advertising or as a impactful component of a multi-media advertising campaign. Like metro systems, buses also have the characteristic that users come into direct and repeated contact with them, becoming a part of their daily lives.\nGiven the high number of bus routes and their well-defined paths, it is possible to deliver the brand message to the target audience in specific areas with the highest efficiency through these mobile billboards. One of the features of bus advertising is that the audience doesn't need to be in a specific location to see it. Instead, buses expose themselves to viewers along their routes through the city, increasing visibility. Due to the repetitive nature of bus routes, an advertisement passes through a specific route multiple times in a day and several days in a month, leading to increased visibility.\nFurthermore, due to the close proximity and the distinctive appearance and coordinates of this mode of transportation, there is the possibility to implement unique and different ideas compared to other media."},
        {"id": 3, "tag": "#subway", "title": "Subway", "desc": "Few are those who have lived in Tehran or have had their work tied to this metropolis and have not experienced using the metro. Considering Tehran's traffic and the well-organized and punctual metro service, the use of this means of transportation is not limited to specific demographics. In metro stations and train cars, one can observe citizens of all kinds choosing the underground commute.\nFor this reason, this transportation system, the largest in the Middle East with 250 kilometers of rail tunnels, 110 stations, and nearly 200 trains playing a role in the daily movement of approximately 30% of Tehran and its suburbs' passengers, can be a effective and impactful medium for any brand.\nIn recent years, with the integration of metro lines with key centers and terminals such as Imam Khomeini Airport and Mehrabad Airport, a higher percentage of people from various social backgrounds use the metro. Additionally, the connection of Tehran metro lines to the Karaj metropolitan area brings a flood of population to the stations and train cars.\nOn the other hand, diversity in the media available in the metro, such as train exteriors, large displays inside stations, lightboxes, and labels on escalators, displays inside train cars, and plaques, has made it possible for companies and brands to remain open to advertising and creativity. This allows a message to be exposed to the audience through various channels. The enclosed spaces of the metro also create the opportunity for the execution of unique and creative designs."}

Therefore, the key to effectiveness among these messages is to creatively differentiate advertisements to capture attention. In the realm of creativity, creative solutions for reaching the desired goal of attracting customers are discovered and presented. The aim is to ultimately create a message that is seen, effective, and remains memorable for the audience. \n To achieve this, after receiving a customer's order, the creativity team designs a creative strategy based on the target audience and creates a suitable concept. This concept is then translated into text or image using creative methods, forming a unified message that will be the core of a campaign, design, or advertisement. The characteristics of a suitable message are comprehensiveness, practicality, and effectiveness. This ensures that the advertising, by conveying the advertiser's message to the audience, is impactful and successful in raising awareness, introducing the brand, or increasing the effectiveness and success of product or service sales.\nIn the realm of advertising creativity, creativity managers, copywriters, graphic designers, and specialists in motion and animation strive to create the best ideas by correctly targeting their goals for the production of ready-made content."

          "text": "The world is constantly changing, and adapting to new conditions is a prerequisite for survival and growth. Nowadays, using the internet and its various applications has become an inherent part of the collective mindset of human society, to the extent that imagining life without it is nearly impossible for the majority of people worldwide. People spend a significant amount of time on the internet in the digital and virtual space. According to research conducted in Iran, currently, the majority of audiences between the ages of 16 to 45 receive most of their information and news through various digital methods. These media, especially social networks, have become serious competitors for radio and television, with a very high penetration rate among audiences. The advantage for these media lies in the fact that the audience can enter this space at their own will, at any time and place they desire, allowing them to present their messages to the target audience under the best conditions.\nDigital media offer more freedom in idea generation, access to selected age groups, social levels, and, generally, the ability to differentiate target audiences and diversity in visual appeals, making them particularly popular among the younger generation.\nOne of the practical and important features of these media is their ability to gather information with very high accuracy. Unlike some advertising methods, they can provide comprehensive information about the audience and the audience's behavior when confronted with a specific advertisement. This information will be very insightful in understanding the audience and will be highly beneficial for the continued success of any brand."
